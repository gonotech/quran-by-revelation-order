# Quran through Seerah

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: There is no universally agreed upon order to relevation of Quranic Surahs. The order used in this project is based on author's personal research and may be inaccurate. This is more of a project that stemmed from personal research intereset. It is not very systematic in nature. Please do not consider the order of revelation used here as the correct one. But feel free to use it as a study resource while being aware of this disclaimer.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: Please note that order of revelation in not the actual order of Quran. Instead, the actual order of Quran is what found in every Quran (the actual book) where it is ordered from Surah Fatiha to Surah An-Nas. Order of revelation used here (and quite frankly any other order used anywhere else) is mainly for study and research purposes.

## Introduction:
The intended purpose of the "Quran through Seerah" project is to provide a way for the readers to read the Quranic Surahs and verses while being aware of the high level context of the time-period of the revelation of these Surahs. Several sources were used to decide on the order used in this project. The high level context of the Seerah is also taken from an existing well known project. An intuitive UI has been provided to access it from any device with an internet connection - mobile or desktop. Users can decide only to view the translations and/or actual Arabic Quran.

## Overview of how the order in this project was decided:
We used the following resources to come of with the order of revelation:
- https://tanzil.net/docs/revelation_order (which derived information from (a) The History of the Quran by Abu Abd Allah al-Zanjani (pdf book, English translation), (b) Chronological Order of Quranic Surahs, rendered by Kevin P. Edgecomb. (c) Geschichte des Korans by Theodor Noldeke (pdf book, Arabic translation).
- Surah introductions at https://quran.com/ (they used several other sources for these introductions)

The main backbone of the order used in this project is taken from Tanzil.net. This order was slightly modifed for a few Surahs based on the details found in the Surah introduction of Quran.com. The critera for override was that if there was a strong argument in Quran.com's introduction for a particular Surah's order which was in disagreement with the one mentioned in Tanzil.net, then the order suggested in Quran.com's Surah introductions was used. Please note that this was done based on the subjective perception of the author of this project and that judgement can be flawed.


## How the "Seerah summary" for different periods was written:
The Seerah summary for different stages of Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) life is based on MRDF's Prophetic Timeline (https://www.mrdf.co.uk/projects, also, there is an app that nicely portrays this mini Seerah: https://gtaf.org/apps/seerah/). A GPT-summarized (and author reviewed) version of this timeline has been used in this project.
