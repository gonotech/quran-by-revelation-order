# Quran through Seerah

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer 1:** The order of revelation for the Quranic Surahs is not universally agreed upon. The sequence used in this project is based on the author's personal research and may contain inaccuracies. This project is a product of personal interest and research, not a systematic study. Please do not consider the order used here as definitive. However, feel free to use this as a study resource, keeping this disclaimer in mind.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer 2:** The order of revelation presented here is not the actual sequence found in the Quran. The Quran as it exists in its book form is arranged from Surah Al-Fatiha to Surah An-Nas. Any alternate order, including the one used in this project, is intended for study and research purposes only.

## Introduction

The "Quran through Seerah" project aims to provide readers with an understanding of the Quranic Surahs and verses within the context of the historical period during which they were revealed. Various sources have been used to determine the sequence of Surahs in this project. The high-level context of the Seerah is also derived from a well-known project. The interface is intuitive, allowing access from any device—mobile or desktop. Users can choose to view translations and/or the original Arabic text of the Quran.

## Project Overview: Deciding the Order of Revelation

The order of revelation in this project was derived from the following resources:

- [Tanzil.net Documentation](https://tanzil.net/docs/revelation_order), which sources information from:
  - "The History of the Quran" by Abu Abd Allah al-Zanjani (PDF, English translation)
  - "Chronological Order of Quranic Surahs," rendered by Kevin P. Edgecomb
  - "Geschichte des Korans" by Theodor Noldeke (PDF, Arabic translation)
  
- Surah introductions available at [Quran.com](https://quran.com/), which utilizes several additional sources.

The primary order used in this project is based on Tanzil.net, with minor modifications for certain Surahs influenced by the Surah introductions on Quran.com. If Quran.com's introduction presented a strong case for a different sequence, it was used in place of Tanzil.net's order. Please note that these decisions were made subjectively by the project's author, and there is room for error.

## Seerah Summary Methodology

The Seerah summary for the different stages of Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) life is derived from the MRDF's Prophetic Timeline ([MRDF Projects](https://www.mrdf.co.uk/projects)). An app that provides a well-structured portrayal of this Seerah is available [here](https://gtaf.org/apps/seerah/). A GPT-summarized version of this timeline, reviewed by the author, has been integrated into this project.

## Translations

The translations used in this project are sourced from [Quran JSON](https://github.com/risan/quran-json).
